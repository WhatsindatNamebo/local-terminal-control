# local-terminal-control

This is a simple script that allows you to type in a simple prompt into it, and the ai will use your terminal to execute all of the commands you need to make your request happen.

It does have a bit of setup, which is to execute these commands in your project directory.
(PS This only works on MacOS for now windows support will be soon.)

```
git clone https://github.com/WhatsindatNamebo/local-terminal-control.git
